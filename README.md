**GOALS:**\
This project aims to provide a comprehensive system for tracking and analyzing running activities.
It will feature classes for recording detailed run data, including distance, duration, energy expenditure, and more.
There will be utilities for handling conversions into different units.
Runs will be exported to pdf files for easy readability.
They will also be exported to a json file, so you can later analyze multiple runs and visualize changes.

**TODO:**
- Add input_run function to import a new run
- Add input function for every attribute
- Add functions to import all runs
- Add function for visualization
- Add function to combine all pdf into one diary
- Sort methods in classes
